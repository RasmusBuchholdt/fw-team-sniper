Are you tired of missing out on popular Fitness World Teams? Well fear no more!

This tool can be run with specific filters to automatically book teams for you, so you always have a spot.

## Usage

You are able to configure the sniper to suit your needs, where you have the following filters for your sniper:

- Target center
- Activity type
- Date of the team
- Time of the team
- Instructor of the team
- Level of the team

You can opt in for these filters to narrow down the specific team you want to snipe.

### Getting the filters right

This section will demonstrate how to finding and using the filters.
